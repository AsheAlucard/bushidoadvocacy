      <h2>Integrity (Makoto)</h2>
      <p>Makoto is the virtue of honesty and sincerity. To the samurai, words and actions had to be aligned — falsehood or deceit destroyed trust and honor.</p>

      <h3>History & Cultural Significance</h3>
      <p>Samurai treated promises as sacred. A man of Bushidō did not need written contracts — his word was binding. Makoto meant absolute sincerity, not just avoiding lies but embodying truthfulness in all dealings.</p>
      <p>Integrity was seen as the glue that held together relationships of trust between lords, vassals, and allies.</p>

      <h3>Example in Practice</h3>
      <p>Keeping a dangerous vow even when it brings hardship, or admitting one’s mistakes openly, were considered acts of Makoto.</p>

      <h3>Practical Lesson</h3>
      <p>Makoto in daily life means being dependable, truthful, and transparent. It builds the trust that makes relationships and communities thrive.</p>
