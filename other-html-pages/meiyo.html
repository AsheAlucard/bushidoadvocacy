      <h2>Honor (Meiyo)</h2>
      <p>Meiyo is the virtue of honor, the esteem earned through righteous conduct. For a samurai, honor was worth more than life itself, as it defined their reputation and legacy.</p>

      <h3>History & Cultural Significance</h3>
      <p>Samurai culture placed immense importance on honor. A warrior who lost their honor might choose seppuku (ritual suicide) rather than live with disgrace. Honor shaped every action and ensured that warriors acted responsibly with the power they wielded.</p>
      <p>Honor extended beyond the battlefield — in family life, governance, and commerce, a samurai’s word and reputation had to remain untarnished.</p>

      <h3>Example in Practice</h3>
      <p>Refusing bribes, keeping promises at great personal cost, or choosing death over betrayal were ways samurai upheld Meiyo.</p>

      <h3>Practical Lesson</h3>
      <p>Honor means aligning one’s actions with their values consistently. In modern life, this is the integrity of keeping your word and protecting your reputation through honesty.</p>
