      <h2>Respect (Rei)</h2>
      <p>Rei is the virtue of courtesy, humility, and respect for others. It governs how samurai interacted with friends, foes, and superiors, ensuring that dignity and honor remained central in every encounter.</p>

      <h3>History & Cultural Significance</h3>
      <p>Samurai followed elaborate codes of etiquette — from bowing before combat to observing ritualized manners in court. These behaviors weren’t superficial but were intended to show respect for others, reflecting the inner discipline of the warrior.</p>
      <p>Respect helped prevent unnecessary conflict and fostered trust between allies and even enemies. Without Rei, strength and skill could turn into arrogance and chaos.</p>

      <h3>Example in Practice</h3>
      <p>In duels, warriors would bow before and after combat, acknowledging the humanity of their opponent, no matter the outcome of the fight.</p>

      <h3>Practical Lesson</h3>
      <p>Rei reminds us that true strength is shown through humility and compassion. Respecting others, even rivals, builds bridges rather than barriers.</p>
