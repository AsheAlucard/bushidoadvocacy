      <h3>History & Cultural Significance</h3>
      <p>Righteousness has been central to Bushid≈ç since its inception. Samurai were expected to act justly not only toward their lord but also toward villagers, merchants, and even defeated foes. Gi was seen as the moral compass, ensuring that power and skill were tempered by ethical judgment.</p>
      <p>Historical texts, such as <em>Hagakure</em> and <em>Bushid≈ç: The Soul of Japan</em>, emphasize that a warrior without righteousness is dishonorable. Decisions in life and battle were judged not only by effectiveness but by the principle of justice.</p>

      <h3>Example in Practice</h3>
      <p>One famous example involves a samurai who discovered corruption in his lord‚Äôs court. Instead of staying silent for personal gain, he confronted the situation, exposing the wrongdoing and protecting innocent people. This act, though dangerous, exemplified Gi by putting justice above personal safety.</p>
      <p>In daily life, Gi manifests as honesty, fairness, and responsibility in interactions with others. Modern interpretations encourage standing up for what is right, even when unpopular, and honoring commitments with integrity.</p>

      <h3>Practical Lesson</h3>
      <p>Righteousness teaches that moral courage often requires difficult choices. It is not enough to be skilled or strong; ethical action defines true leadership and trustworthiness.</p>
