      <h2>Courage (Yu)</h2>
      <p>Yu is the bravery to act rightly in the face of fear, uncertainty, and danger. It does not mean recklessness, but the strength to choose the harder path when it is the right one.</p>

      <h3>History & Cultural Significance</h3>
      <p>Samurai courage was not measured only in battle but also in the courage to speak truth to power, defend the weak, and remain steadfast against corruption. Cowardice was one of the greatest disgraces a warrior could bear.</p>
      <p>Courage in Bushidō is always paired with wisdom. Reckless action without purpose was considered folly, not bravery.</p>

      <h3>Example in Practice</h3>
      <p>A samurai risking their life to protect villagers from bandits embodied Yu, for they chose honor and justice over self-preservation.</p>

      <h3>Practical Lesson</h3>
      <p>True courage is doing what is right, even when fear whispers otherwise. It asks us to rise above hesitation and take action in line with our values.</p>
