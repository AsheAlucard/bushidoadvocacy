      <h2>Compassion (Jin)</h2>
      <p>Jin is the virtue of compassion and empathy. Samurai were expected to use their power not only for warfare but also for protecting and aiding those in need.</p>

      <h3>History & Cultural Significance</h3>
      <p>Jin emphasized benevolence as a hallmark of a true warrior. Samurai who acted with cruelty or indifference to the suffering of others were seen as dishonorable. Compassion balanced martial strength with humanity.</p>
      <p>During times of peace, many samurai devoted themselves to governance, charity, and scholarship, extending their protective role into society.</p>

      <h3>Example in Practice</h3>
      <p>A samurai sparing the life of a surrendered opponent, or providing aid to a famine-stricken village, exemplifies Jin.</p>

      <h3>Practical Lesson</h3>
      <p>Compassion today means recognizing the struggles of others and acting to relieve suffering where possible. Strength without kindness is empty.</p>
