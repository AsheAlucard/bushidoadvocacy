      <h2>Loyalty (Chuugi)</h2>
      <p>Chuugi is the virtue of loyalty — the unwavering dedication to one’s lord, comrades, and code of honor. It was the bond that held samurai society together.</p>

      <h3>History & Cultural Significance</h3>
      <p>Loyalty was considered the highest duty of the samurai. Betrayal of one’s lord or comrades was unthinkable and punishable by death. Loyalty created stability in the feudal system and defined the warrior’s place in society.</p>
      <p>This loyalty was not blind obedience but an oath of faithfulness, balanced with righteousness and justice.</p>

      <h3>Example in Practice</h3>
      <p>The 47 Ronin, who avenged their master’s wrongful death despite the consequences, became the ultimate symbol of Chuugi.</p>

      <h3>Practical Lesson</h3>
      <p>In modern times, loyalty means commitment to one’s principles, family, and community. It is about being dependable and standing with others through hardship.</p>
